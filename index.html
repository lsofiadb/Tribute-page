                Charles Darwin was a British naturalist and biologist who lived during the 19th century. He is best known for his theory of evolution, which he developed during his travels and observations as a naturalist aboard the HMS Beagle. His groundbreaking book, "On the Origin of Species," introduced the concept of natural selection and revolutionized the way that scientists and the public alike understood the diversity of life on Earth. Darwin's work had a profound impact on the fields of biology, geology, and anthropology, and continues to influence scientific thought to this day.
